# Exploratory Data Analysis of Cardiovascular Risk Features

**Data Source**: The dataset used in this project is derived from the Framingham Study, focusing on cardiovascular risk features such as blood pressure and cholesterol. Extracted and consolidated into a single CSV file, this data is publicly available for use and consists of 4000+ records and 15+features

**Primary Data Science Question**:  How do cardiovascular risk features (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol) of patients who smoke vary from those who do not?

**Key Results:**
*Visuals*:
Blood Pressure:

-Both smokers and non-smokers show a slight upward trend in blood pressure (BP) with age.
-Non-smokers generally exhibit greater variability in BP compared to smokers.

Cholesterol:
-Non-smokers show greater variability in cholesterol levels compared to smokers.

Heart Rate:
-Females have a higher average heart rate than males across all smoking statuses and risk groups.
-Smokers, both male and female, tend to have slightly higher heart rates than non-smokers within the same risk group.
