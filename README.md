# Exploratory Data Analysis of Cardiovascular Risk Features

**Data Source**: The dataset used in this project is derived from the Framingham Study, focusing on cardiovascular risk features such as blood pressure and cholesterol. Extracted and consolidated into a single CSV file, this data is publicly available for use and consists of 4000+ records and 15+features

**Primary Data Science Question**:  How do cardiovascular risk features (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol) of patients who smoke vary from those who do not?

**Key Results:**

*Visuals:*

 Blood Pressure:
- Both smokers and non-smokers show an upward trend in blood pressure (BP) with age.
- Non-smokers generally exhibit greater variability in BP compared to smokers.

 Cholesterol:
- Non-smokers show greater variability in cholesterol levels compared to smokers.

 Heart Rate:
- Females have a higher average heart rate than males across all smoking statuses and risk groups.
- Smokers, both male and female, tend to have slightly higher heart rates than non-smokers within the same risk group.

**Conclusion:**

- We identified interesting patterns in smoking behaviors and cardiovascular health.
- Our results align with existing literature, showing a causal relationship between smoking and higher resting heart rates.
- There was no clear correlation between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and resting heart rate.
- The relationship between smoking and cardiovascular health appears more complex than initially thought.
- Additional data on lifestyle choices and healthcare habits is needed for more accurate correlations.
- Next steps involve refining risk models and conducting further statistical analysis.
