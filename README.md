**Exploratory Data Analysis of Cardiovascular Risk Features**

Data Source: The dataset used in this project is derived from the Framingham Study, focusing on cardiovascular risk features such as blood pressure and cholesterol. Extracted and consolidated into a single CSV file, this data is publicly available for use and consists of 4000+ records and 15+features

Primary Data Science Question: The central inquiry of this project is: How do cardiovascular risk features (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol) of patients who smoke vary from those who do not?

Project Goals:

Analyze the relationships between smoking behavior and cardiovascular risk factors. Investigate the impact of smoking on blood pressure, cholesterol, and Heart Rate. Contribute insights to the development of therapeutics and community health interventions for cardiovascular disease.
